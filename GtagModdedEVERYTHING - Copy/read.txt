I woke up at 6am wanting to play Gorilla Tag so I plug in my headset to my laptop and start installing some of the new maps
that have come out recently so I spent nearly 2 and a half hours to make this entire thing that nobody might even see
so yeah... what am i doing... well it's 25 minutes until I have to go to school now, thanks for reading ig


So i dont know if this will work at all, took almost 2 hours so you're welcome for the insane time save.


I use Oculus Quest 2, instructions may be different for other VR headsets, I have no experience with anything but the Quest 2.
